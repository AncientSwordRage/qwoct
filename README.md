Esolang Specification designed to be written one handed while giving you a headache

## Commands
QWOCT only has 8 commands or letters which each have a base function, which maniulates a list or queue. To write programs, the letters are combined into words which have related functions.

### Letters

#### *Q* - Queue
Input and output goes via the queue, so all commands that directly manipulate the queue or it's contents.

#### *W* - Words
Commands which directly effect the command words themselves.

#### *E* - Each, or element-wise
Modified a command to be run on each element of a queue.

#### *R* - Return, or reverse
Return to the start of the current queue, or reverse the current function.

#### *T* - Transform
Changes the element at the current position.

#### *Y* - whY
Used to indicate a switch in the code (much like an if-statement or filter)

#### *U* - Uncrement
The opposite of Increment, used to lower the current value, or to pop an element off of the current queue.

#### *I* - Incremenet
The opposite of Uncrement, used to raise the current value, or add a value to queue
